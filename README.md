## What is Jottype?
### Jottype is a fast and reliable notetaking react app. With a focus on simplicity, I wanted users to be able to quickly access their own notes, and swiftly create notes in Jottype. 

### Jottype allows users to create a note, and then saves that note to a browser localstorage. Which allow user to not loss teir note data unless using Jottype in a private tab. 

## What Features are Currently Working?
### ☑️ Ability to change the note's body font size, font color, font weight, make a font italicize and include a underline.
### ☑️ Dark and Light Theme.
### ☑️ Ability to search all notes that are saved on localstorage.

## What Features are Coming to Jottype?
### 🔜 Account creation and use of a different way to store note data that will enable the use of cross device sharing of notes.
### 🔜 Ability to use tabs in the body of a note.
### 🔜 Use of a new color picker rather than the system color pickers.
### 🔜 Full mobile support.
